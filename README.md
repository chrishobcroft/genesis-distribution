# Straightedge Genesis Distribution

This repository contains contributions from the Straightedge Launch Community, to the process of agreeing and generating the genesis distribution, and hence the genesis block to be validated at the launch of the Straightedge chain.

## Overview

When Straightedge launches, validators will start by validating the same **genesis block file**.

This **genesis block file** will contain the initial **"genesis" distribution** of STR tokens.

The **"genesis" distribution** of STR tokens will consist of:

- Lock / Signal Data and Addresses submitted to Edgeware's lockdrop, stored in Ethereum blockchain

  - This can be defined algorithmically, based on a set of parameters and code to parse Ethereum blockchain's chainstate
  
  - See [lockdrop data](./lockdrop-data.md) for an overview of this data

- Allocations to Addresses owned by participants in the Straightedge Launch Community

  - _The amounts allocated to these addresses has not yet been finalised_

  - **_Technically, this will only be finalised when the chain launches...!_**

## Community Survey

This project is collecting opinions regarding the genesis distribution for Straightedge.
