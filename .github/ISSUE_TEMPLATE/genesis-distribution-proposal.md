# Overview

This issue is to propose how to distribute the 5,000,000,000 STR tokens which will be created when the Straightedge network is launched.

## Split between Straightedge Launch Community, Lockdrop Participants, and any others

This section describes how many STR to allocate to **individuals who participate in Straightedge Launch Community**, how many STR to allocate to **participants in Edgeware's lockdrop**, and how many to allocate to **any other individuals** (please specify).

I propose to allocate:

XX% to individuals who participate in Straightedge Launch Community
YY% to participants in Edgeware's lockdrop
ZZ% to other (please specify)

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | As an example, Edgeware will allocate 90% to Lockdrop Participants, and
 | 10% to Launch Community (Commonwealth, Parity, Early Contributors).
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## How to allocate to Straightedge Launch Community

You have proposed for XX% of STR to be allocated to individuals who participate in Straightedge Launch Community. This section describes how you think these STR tokens should be allocated.

_Please provide as much detail as possible, to help create the distribution that you think would have the best chance of the network being successful. Please provide details of how you think the XX% should be divided between e.g. project initiators, validators, developers, community builders. Also, please provide details for how the allocations should be agreed by the community._

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | As an example, Edgeware will allocate 10% to Launch Community. This will be divided
 | between Commonwealth (4.5%), Parity and others (3%), and Early Contributors (2.5%).
 | This allocation was decided by the Edgeware team, and the decision about how to
 | allocate to Early Contributors will also be taken by the Edgeware team.

## How to allocate to participants in Edgeware's lockdrop

You have proposed for YY% of STR to be allocated to participants in participants in Edgeware's lockdrop. This section describes how you think these STR tokens should be allocated.

### Overview

The following data is being collected by Edgeware's lockdrop:

- Signals from Addresses
- Signals from Contracts
- Locks (not electing themselves as validators)
- Locks (electing themselves as validators)

Straightedge has proposed that Signals from Contract (and so called "Generalized Locks") are excluded from the token distribution.

### Locking Bonuses - Longer Locking


### Locking Bonuses - Early Locking


### Signaling


### Other
